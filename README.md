## Overview
The **Virus Gene Evolution Analyzer** is a tool designed to compare viral genomes and analyze the evolutionary processes shaping their genes. This tool computes the **dN/dS ratio** for common protein-coding genes shared between two viral genomes (in this case, SARS-CoV-2 strains). The **dN/dS ratio** is a key indicator of the evolutionary pressures acting on genes, classifying them into three categories:

- **Positive selection** (dN/dS > 1): Indicates that mutations that alter the protein sequence are favored, possibly suggesting adaptive evolution.
- **Negative selection** (dN/dS < 1): Indicates that mutations that alter the protein sequence are detrimental and selected against.
- **Neutral selection** (dN/dS â‰ˆ 1): Indicates that mutations occur but do not have a significant effect on the organism's fitness.

## Features
- **Fetch Genomic Data**: Retrieves viral genomic data from GenBank using accession numbers.
- **Gene Comparison**: Identifies common and unique genes between two genomes.
- **dN/dS Calculation**: Computes the **dN (non-synonymous substitutions)** and **dS (synonymous substitutions)** for common genes between the genomes and calculates the **dN/dS ratio**.
- **Selection Type Classification**: Determines whether a gene is under **positive selection**, **negative selection**, or is **neutral** based on the dN/dS ratio.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the necessary dependencies.

1. Install **Biopython** and **CodonAlign** via pip:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

## Usage
### Step-by-Step Guide:
1. **Fetch GenBank data**: The program fetches genomic data for two viruses using their GenBank accession numbers (e.g., NC_045512.2 and PV009232.1).
2. **Gene Comparison**: The common genes between the two viral genomes are identified.
3. **Calculate dN/dS Ratio**: For each common gene, the program calculates the **dN/dS ratio** and classifies the gene into one of the following categories:
   - **Positive Selection**
   - **Negative Selection**
   - **Neutral Selection**
4. **Output**: The results are printed in a tabular format, showing the **gene name**, **dN**, **dS**, **dN/dS ratio**, and the type of selection acting on the gene.

### Example Usage:
To run the program, simply execute the script in Python:

```bash
python main.py
```
